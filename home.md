  Sydney, Australia. I love to build narratives through technology, create accessible
  experiences for people of all backgrounds and abilities, and experiment with the
  intersection of digital and spatial design.

  copy: I'm a user experience engineer with a strong foundation in interaction, visual,
    and information design and media theory and robust full-stack experience. I particularly
    love to build narratives through technology, create accessible experiences for
    people of all backgrounds and abilities, and experiment with the intersection
    of digital and spatial design. You can check out my latest work as the product
