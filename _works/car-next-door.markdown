snippet: Australia's largest peer-to-peer car sharing platform
description: "Uber Carshare (formerly known as Car Next Door) was a platform that
  allowed car owners to share their cars with vetted borrowers using in-car technology
  that facilitates key handover. By making it simple to turn any car into a share
  car, more Australians could live car-free or make better use of their under-utilised
  cars. \n\nI led the design of both the web and mobile applications since November
  2017. As a solo product designer in a lean tech team, I wore a lot of hats and solved
  a wide array of problems – and this quickly expanded to solving the way we solve
  problems. Through establishing scalable team structures and processes and a compelling
  product strategy, I built a highly engaged and effective team of user experience
  and product professionals. I left my role as Chief Product Officer in 2024 to pursue
  a career in teaching."
question: How can Uber Carshare achieve its mission of freeing people and the planet
  from the 'one person, one car' mentality?
