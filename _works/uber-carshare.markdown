snippet: Australia's largest peer-to-peer car sharing platform
description: Car Next Door is a platform that allows car owners to share their cars
  with vetted borrowers using in-car technology that facilitates key handover. By
  making it simple to turn any car into a share car, more Australians can live car-free
  or make better use of their under-utilised cars. I've led the design of both the
  web and mobile applications at Car Next Door since November 2017 and now manage
  our growing team of product managers, designers and researchers.
question: How can Uber Carshare achieve its mission of freeing people and the planet
  from the 'one person, one car' mentality?
